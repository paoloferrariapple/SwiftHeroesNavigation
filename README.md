This project has been created to showcase what i think the new navigation could look like.
I have made a simple rappresentation of this method in the two branches:
  - checkpoints/BasicNavigationOnly with only the code and no comments
  - checkpoints/BasicNavigationWithComments where i added comments to relevant parts of the code

I will be adding new branches with various types and additions, possibly with packages and different styles of architecture
